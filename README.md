# 📊 Customer Churn Prediction

This project predicts whether a customer is likely to churn (leave a service) using a machine learning model with a simple Streamlit web app.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Train a TensorFlow model to predict churn.
- Clean and preprocess customer data.
- Evaluate model accuracy.
- Run an interactive web app with Streamlit.
- Input new customer data and get predictions.

## 📈 How it Works

1. Load and preprocess the data.
2. Train a TensorFlow model to classify churn.
3. Save/load the model.
4. Use the Streamlit app to enter customer details.
5. Get a predicted churn probability instantly.
